           Computer networking connects devices like computers, servers, printers through cables or wireless to make data sharing possible.
           A node is any device that can send, receive or forward data into a network. It is essential for Cyber Security Professionals to have a solid understanding of how computers communicate. 
           There is much more happening behind the scenes of computer networks than what can be observed when using applications.
